# Agents (Template)

This folder is reserved for future automation agents. Populate it after copying the template by creating Markdown files that describe each agentâ€™s purpose, triggers, validation checks, and success criteria.

## When You Add Agents
- Document configuration details in frontmatter or tables.
- Reference supporting automation in `.codex/ci/` and `.codex/workflows/`.
- Update `codex.md` with the commands or processes that interact with the agent.
