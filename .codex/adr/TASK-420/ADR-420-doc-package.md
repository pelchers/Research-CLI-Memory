# ADR-420 Documentation Package

- **Status:** Planning
- **Task:** TASK-420
- **Owner:** Codex Memory Research Team
- **Last Updated:** 2025-10-16

## Context
The new persistence layer requires comprehensive documentation for setup, operations, troubleshooting, and migration (`research/refined-research-1/analysis/persistence_recommendations.md:80`).

## Decision
Produce a documentation set containing:
- User guide (enablement, commands, workflow examples).
- Administrator guide (file locations, backups, overrides).
- Migration notes (seeding cache from historical rollouts).
- FAQ / troubleshooting matrix.

Docs will live in `.codex/docs/project/` with links from `research/`.

## Implementation Steps
1. Outline documentation structure aligning with PRD/TRD.
2. Draft guides using insights from ADRs and research.
3. Review for clarity, include screenshots or CLI excerpts.
4. Integrate docs into release checklist.

## Success Criteria
- Docs reviewed by project stakeholders.
- Examples validated against working prototype.
- Migration instructions tested successfully.
