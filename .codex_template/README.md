# Codex Directory Template

This folder contains a clean `.codex/` structure you can copy into a new repository. It strips out project-specific ADRs, research artefacts, and plans while preserving the conventions established during the Codex Memory Research project.

## Usage Steps
1. Copy the entire `.codex_template/` directory into your new repository and rename it to `.codex/`.
2. Read `.codex/docs/project/how-to-bootstrap-codex-directory.md` for the initialisation checklist.
3. Replace placeholder content (PRD/TRD/implementation plan) with project-specific details.
4. Create new ADRs for each planned task following the guidance in `how-to-bootstrap-codex-directory.md`.
5. Commit the initialised `.codex/` directory as part of your project setup.
