# Continuous Integration (Reserved)

Use this directory to store CI/CD definitions, validation scripts, and automation blueprints tied to the Codex memory persistence workflow.

## Recommended Contents
- GitHub Actions workflows or equivalent pipeline definitions.
- Pre-commit/pre-push hook scripts for cache-related validations.
- Documentation describing how automation integrates with ADR tasks and quality gates.

## Guidelines
- Keep pipelines fast and deterministic; log clearly when cache or task graph state becomes stale.
- Reference relevant ADR IDs and update `.codex/docs/project/implementation-plan.md` when new automation is introduced.
