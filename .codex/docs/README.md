# Documentation

This area consolidates all written references supporting the memory persistence workstream.

## Subdirectories
- `project/` â€“ PRD, TRD, implementation plan, overview, and helper guides (e.g., bootstrapping instructions).
- (Future) additional folders may be added for onboarding, reference material, or workflow notes. Add a README when new sections appear.

## Maintenance Guidelines
- Keep project documents in sync with the implementation plan and ADRs.
- Update `how-to-bootstrap-codex-directory.md` whenever the initialisation process changes.
- When adding new documentation areas, include a README explaining their purpose and link them from here.
