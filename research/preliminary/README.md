# Memory Persistence Research Workspace

This workspace tracks designs for improving long-lived project context in AI CLI tooling. All notes focus on repository-centered development workflows and build on learnings from the open-source Codex CLI.

- `plan.md` - research backlog, active tasks, and decision tracker.
- `analysis/` - structured evaluations for proposed persistence models.
- `notes/` - running scratchpad for observations or interview-style insights.
- `sources/` - collected references, links, and citations for follow-up.

Each deliverable produced for the user response should be staged inside this directory tree.
