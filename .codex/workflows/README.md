# Workflows (Reserved)

This folder is intended for end-to-end process documentation and executable workflows that support the Codex memory persistence effort.

## Examples
- Step-by-step guides for running cache migrations or reconciliation drills.
- Automation scripts coordinating agents, CI jobs, and documentation updates.
- Templates for recurring activities (e.g., research phase transitions).

## Maintenance
- Keep workflows up-to-date with the implementation plan and ADRs.
- Reference the relevant README when introducing new scripts or processes.
