# Workflows (Template)

Use this directory to document repeatable processes or to store automation scripts after the template is installed in a new project.

## Getting Started
- Create subfolders or markdown files for each workflow.
- Describe goals, inputs, outputs, and related commands/agents.
- Keep the documentation current with the implementation plan and ADR decisions.
