# Toolchains (Reserved)

Store build, runtime, and developer tooling configuration here when the memory persistence project requires it.

## Potential Uses
- Local development scripts (e.g., cache migration helpers, git drift simulators).
- Container or Nix configurations tailored to Codex experimentation.
- Tool-specific README files describing setup and usage.

## Best Practices
- Keep configurations version-controlled alongside ADR references.
- Document dependencies and operating system requirements.
- Update `codex.md` and project docs whenever new tooling becomes essential.
