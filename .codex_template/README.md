# Codex Directory Template

This folder contains a clean `.codex/` layout you can copy into a new repository. It mirrors the conventions used in the Codex Memory Persistence project but omits project-specific ADRs and documentation.

## Usage Steps
1. Copy the entire `.codex_template/` directory into your new repository and rename it to `.codex/`.
2. After copying, open `.codex/docs/project/how-to-bootstrap-codex-directory.md` for the full initialisation checklist.
3. Replace placeholder documents (PRD, TRD, implementation plan, overview) with project-specific content.
4. Populate `.codex/adr/` with task folders and ADRs tailored to your roadmap.
5. Review the README in each subdirectory (`agents/`, `ci/`, `toolchains/`, `workflows/`) to understand how to extend the structure.
6. Commit the initialised `.codex/` directory as part of your project setup.
