# Agents (Reserved)

This folder is reserved for future Codex automation agents. While the Memory Persistence project does not yet define agents, use this space to document and version any workflows that will be triggered automatically or via slash commands.

## When Adding Agents
1. Document each agent in a dedicated Markdown file with frontmatter describing name, purpose, triggers, validation checks, and success criteria.
2. Update `codex.md` with any new commands or workflow requirements.
3. Link related automation (CI pipelines, validation scripts) in the corresponding directories (`ci/`, `workflows/`).

## Reference
- See `.codex/docs/project/how-to-bootstrap-codex-directory.md` for how to initialise this area in new projects.
