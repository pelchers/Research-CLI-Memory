# Continuous Integration (Template)

Use this directory to version control pipeline definitions, validation scripts, or automation hooks once the project requires them.

1. Add CI configuration files (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
2. Document prerequisites and how the pipelines relate to ADR tasks.
3. Keep scripts lightweight and provide clear failure messages.
