# Codex Directory

This directory houses all Codex-specific conventions, documentation, and planning artefacts for the Memory Persistence project.

## Layout
- `codex.md` – session conventions, workflows, and quality gates.
- `docs/` – project documentation (PRD, TRD, implementation plan, bootstrapping guide).
- `adr/` – Architecture Decision Records organised per task.
- `agents/` – (reserved) automation agent definitions for future workflows.
- `ci/` – (reserved) continuous integration and automation blueprints.
- `toolchains/` – (reserved) build/runtime tool configuration.
- `workflows/` – (reserved) end-to-end process documentation and execution scripts.

Refer to the README inside each subdirectory for details on how to maintain or initialise that component.
