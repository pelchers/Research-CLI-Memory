# ADR Workspace (Template)

- Create a subdirectory per task (e.g., `TASK-001`).
- Within each subdirectory, store ADR files following the naming convention `ADR-###-short-name.md`.
- Each ADR should include: Context, Decision, Implementation Steps, Success Criteria, References, Status.
- Remove this README once your ADR structure is in place.
