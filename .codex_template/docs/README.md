# Documentation (Template)

The `docs/` directory holds project documentation after the template is copied into a new repository.

## Subdirectories
- `project/` â€“ includes placeholder PRD, TRD, implementation plan, overview, and the bootstrap guide. Replace these with project-specific documents.

## Getting Started
1. Update each placeholder file with accurate information for your project.
2. Add additional subdirectories (e.g., `workflows/`, `reference/`) as needed and document them with README files.
3. Keep the documentation aligned with ADRs and the implementation plan.
