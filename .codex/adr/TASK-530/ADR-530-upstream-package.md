# ADR-530 Upstream Contribution Package

- **Status:** Planning
- **Task:** TASK-530
- **Owner:** Codex Memory Research Team
- **Last Updated:** 2025-10-16

## Context
Once the feature stabilises we intend to upstream it to the Codex repository. Preparing a contribution package ensures maintainers can evaluate the changes efficiently (`research/refined-research-1/analysis/persistence_recommendations.md:47`).

## Decision
Assemble an upstream package containing:
- Feature overview + motivation (linking to research docs).
- Testing matrix results (unit, integration, migration).
- Risk assessment and rollback plan.
- Step-by-step release checklist (enable flag, monitor metrics, announce).

Package will live in `docs/` and accompany the PR.

## Implementation Steps
1. Draft contribution proposal referencing PRD/TRD.
2. Compile test evidence and telemetry snapshots.
3. Outline rollout/rollback instructions for maintainers.
4. Review with internal stakeholders before submission.

## Success Criteria
- Contribution package reviewed internally.
- Maintainers can follow checklist without additional context.
- PR references package and ADRs.
